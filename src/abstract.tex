In electrophysiology, the amount of experimental data is immense.  For
the German Node of the International Neuroinformatics Coordinating
Facility, there was a need for a Graphical User Interface tool that
made it easy to organise, share, annotate and view experimental data
easily.  Existing tools had split functionality amongst themselves
requiring one tool to annotate and perhaps another to view.  It was
decided that a single unified tool working out of the browser would be
most helpful.  My work with the G-Node was on developing such a tool
and integrating it with existing software infrastructure on their
servers.  This report overviews my approach, some peculiarities about
the problems I faced and the technologies and techniques I used to
develop WDAT - A Web Data Analysis Tool.
