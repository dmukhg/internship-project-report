In electrophysiology, the amount of experimental data is huge.  For
the German node of the International Neuroinformatics Coordinating
Facility, there was a need for a Graphical User Interface tool that
allowed them to organise the experiments, view the experimental data, 
make annotations, edit some properties and share the experiments with
colleagues.  Existing tools were either in two or more parts,
requiring one to annotate with one tool and view with the other etc.  
It was decided that a single unified tool working out of the browser
would be most helpful.  My work with the G-Node was on developing such
a tool and integrating it with existing software infrastructure on
their servers.  This report details my approach, some peculiarties
about the problems I faced and the technologies and techniques I used
to develop WDAT - A Web Data Analysis Tool.
